## Architecture Patterns

### Definition: 
Architecture patterns are high-level solutions to recurring problems in system-wide structure and organization of software systems.

### Scope:
Entire system or subsystem level.

### Purpose:
To define how components interact, how data flows, and how the system is structured and deployed.

### Examples:

- Layered Architecture (e.g., Presentation → Business → Data)
- Microservices Architecture
- Event-Driven Architecture
- Client-Server Architecture
- Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)

### Focus:
Big-picture concerns like scalability, maintainability, deployment, separation of concerns, and communication between system parts.


## Design Patterns

### Definition:
Design patterns are medium- to low-level solutions to common problems in object-oriented design.

### Scope:
Focused on individual classes, modules, or small groups of components.

### Purpose:
To solve specific problems in object creation, composition, and interaction.

### Examples (Gang of Four):

- Creational: Singleton, Factory, Builder
- Structural: Adapter, Composite, Decorator
- Behavioral: Observer, Strategy, Command

### Focus:
Code-level concerns like object creation, communication, extensibility, and reusability.

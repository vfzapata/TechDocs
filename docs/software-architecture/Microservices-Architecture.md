## Microservices Architecture

Microservices Architecture is a software architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small and independently deployable services. Each service is responsible for a specific business capability and communicates with others through lightweight protocols, often HTTP/REST or messaging queues.

## Key Concepts
- <strong>Service Independence:</strong> Each microservice is an autonomous unit with its own database and lifecycle, enabling independent development, deployment, and scaling.

- <strong>Decentralized Data Management:</strong> Each service owns its data and there is no central database shared among services.

- <strong>API Contracts:</strong> Services communicate through well-defined APIs, promoting clear boundaries and minimizing coupling.

- <strong>Resilience and Scalability:</strong> Microservices can be scaled independently and isolated failures prevent system-wide outages.

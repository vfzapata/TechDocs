## Frontend Architecture Guide
Frontend architecture is not a one-size-fits-all discipline. In an ever-evolving landscape of technologies and frameworks, the "best" approach often depends on the project's context, the business domain, and the development team's expertise. The goal of this guide is to outline foundational principles and practices that help define a scalable, maintainable, and efficient frontend architecture.

## Core Principles
Regardless of the stack or methodology, the following principles should be at the core of any frontend architecture:

1. <strong>Modularity:</strong> Break down the application into self-contained, reusable components or modules.
   
   </br><strong>Why it matters:</strong>
   - Promotes reuse across the application
   - Simplifies testing and debugging
   - Enhances readability and team collaboration
  
   </br><strong>Example:</strong> A Button component should be reusable across the entire app with different props such as variant, size, or onClick logic.

   ```
   <Button variant="primary" size="lg" onClick={handleSubmit}>
    Submit
   </Button>
   ```

2. <strong>Clear and Clean Project Navigation:</strong> Organize files and folders in a consistent, discoverable structure.
   
   </br><strong>Why it matters:</strong>
   - Improves developer onboarding
   - Speeds up development by making code easier to find
   - Reduces merge conflicts and duplicated logic
  
   </br><strong>Example folder structure:</strong>
   ```
   src/
    components/
    pages/
    hooks/
    services/
    styles/
    utils/
    state/
   ```

3. <strong>Separation of Concerns:</strong> Divide the project by responsibility, component logic, UI styling, data fetching, and state management should all be handled in isolation.
   
   </br><strong>Why it matters:</strong>
   - Increases maintainability
   - Encourages reuse
   - Simplifies testing
   - Simplifies debugging
  
4. <strong>Clean Code Practices:</strong> Adopt software engineering best practices such as:
   
   - <strong>DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):</strong> Reuse code where possible, avoid duplication.
   - <strong>KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):</strong> Avoid over-engineering.
   - <strong>SOLID principles (when applicable to frontend):</strong> Especially Single Responsibility Principle.
  
   </br><strong>Naming Conventions:</strong> Use consistent and descriptive naming for components, files, and functions. Define these conventions as part of the teamâ€™s style guide.

   </br><strong>Example:</strong>
   - Components: UserCard.tsx|jsx
   - Hooks: useFetchUser.ts|js
   - State files: userStore.ts|js

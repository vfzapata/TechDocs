## Domain Driven Design

Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is a software development approach that focuses on modeling software to match a domain's concepts, processes, and rules. The primary goal is to create a shared understanding of the domain between technical and non-technical stakeholders, allowing for more effective communication and better alignment between business needs and software implementation. 
Its principles are based on:
- First, think about the data that needs to be stored
- Definition of business rules
- Design of the data model
- Software architecture completely dependent on the data
